# brewforce
This project was originally developed and maintained in GitLab as three separate repositories:
- brewforce-fe (Frontend)
- brewforce-be (Backend)
- brewforce-auth (Authentication Service)

For portfolio purposes, the project has been migrated to GitHub and consolidated into a single monorepository while preserving the original service separation.
